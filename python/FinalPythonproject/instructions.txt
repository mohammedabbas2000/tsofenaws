We'll create a program that can:

    create encryption keys, convert them to decryption keys
    save and load keys to files (ex:  my-key.key)
    accept a clear-text file and encrypt it using an encryption key
    Accept an encrypted file, and decrypt.

There is always the "current key"  (the created, or loaded key)
You should write a CLI (command line interface) that a user can use to support all of these actions (see example file).
Programming instructions:

    Create a directory called "enc" under python
    Write a modular program, with different modules for specific tasks; For example:
    - an subs module to handle the cli
    - enckey file to handle the creation of keys
    Your main file should be called subs.pi
